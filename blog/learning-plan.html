    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <p class="blog-text">
    I am open to a number of different career pathways within tech. In 5 years time I would like to have 
    focused on one pathway, rather than floating between different careers. Currently my goal is to be 
    working as either a junior software developer or as a business analyst in a tech company.
    I would like to have a job that allows me the flexibility to not only grow within my self and grow 
    my skills, but also to have a balanced family life. While not a work related goal, I'd also like my career to 
    allow me to continue with my creative hobby- aerials.

    As I mentioned in a the blog about identity values and strength (<a href="identity-and-values.html">click through to read</a>)
    My strengths and limitations do intersect in a lot of ways. My patience can make me a good team member, and help me to 
    solve problems that take time. I also value compassion, and empathy in dealing with other people. I feel like this 
    will help me work with others in times of high stress, like the bootcamp. 
    However as I am stubborn when it comes to asking for help, this can leave me struggling with a problem longer than 
    is necessary- and asking for support in a timely manner will be crucial in this environment. Another of my limitations specifically for this course is the tendency 
    to compare myself with others journeys. I know that everyone will progress at difference paces, but I do find it hard when I feel like I am falling behind. 
    This limits my learning journey in some ways because I can end up feeling demotivated, like I will never catch up.  
    <br></br>
    In support of my goals, would like to see my confidence grow throughout this programme, and to develop a stronger response to
    criticism. I feel like the ability to accept criticism in a constructive way will not only help me learn more effectively,
    but make me a stronger candidate and team member in a working environment. I recognise that a good way to help 
    me achieve this goal will be to share my work with the other members of my cohort, and to share my work with the facilitators
    confidently. Expecting corrections and using them to help me progress with my coding journey instead of taking them as personal criticism.
    I feel like these two are linked, as well. The more I can share my work, and accept criticism, hopefully the more I can share with 
    confidence and feel secure in my learning and knowledge.

    <p class="blog-text">
    In the first few weeks of foundations I have struggled a little with following the time boxes, and have found it
    easy to fall down a rabbit hole of research and information. Throughout the course I will aim to be disciplined with my time- 
    using the toggl tool and the learning competencies to guide me. 
    When I am working in a group I will clearly communicate my expectations, and listen to others expectations. 
    If I am struggling with stress and managing the workload mentally, I will reach out to my facilitators and let them
    know what I am struggling with- but also outlining the support that I feel would help me manage. For example, 
    If I am struggling to get through a piece of work I will ask questions about the work, ask to take a short break
    from the computer and  be allowed to use grounding exercises to help manage my emotions in the moment.  In order to support my 
    mental health during the bootcamp I will make sure I continue to exercise, take breaks from the computer and study and 
    ensure I have access to healthy food that will help me feel well. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-text">
    If I need support from my facilitators, I will reach out after I have worked through my problem solving steps. 
    Because the course is short, I will make sure I do this as effectively as I can. If I am unable to work
    through a technical problem I will use slack to reach out to my cohort, and my facilitators. 
    I also will make sure to request help well before any work is due 
    in, and not wait until close to the deadline. In addition, I feel like it is important to also offer support 
    to other people in my cohort if they ask for it in the slack or during our class. I feel like a readiness to help if I can will foster an
    environment where I can feel comfortable asking for and offering support. 
    To add to this, my expectations of the facilitators are that they will be available to answer questions throughout the course, and 
    help direct my research if I am working through a difficult task.

  <p class="blog-text">
    One major commitment that I have is to be available for my kids at bedtime. I understand that I will be expected to 
    code and work in the evenings during the bootcamp, but I believe that to keep this time calm and relaxed for 
    my children it's important that I still be present for their bedtime- we have always read books and spent 
    quiet time together before bed. I think that committing to this throughout the programme will be beneficial
    for me as well, as it will keep me feeling connected to my kids, despite my role in their lives changing quite
    dramatically during the bootcamp. Other than this, I have organised as much support as possible from my husband 
    and family to make sure that I can make my learning during the bootcamp a priority. I want to get as close
    to my goals as I can with devacademy, and I feel like being able to make it my focus will help me succeed.

    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
   <div class= "blog-text">
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Long term career goal and pathway</h3>
    <p>
      Once I leave devacademy I am hoping to work as a software developer or a business anaylyst.
    I am still flexible in terms of career path, because I believe that even if I don't end up exactly where I expected I would,
      I can still use the knowledge and skills to help me find a career path that I enjoy. 
      When I leave devacademy I hope to show people that there is a place for women in tech. 
      My overall goals are to find a career that allows me the flexibility to also be present with my young family. 
    
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Strengths and Limitations</h3>
    <p>
    My limitations in terms of my learning in boot camp are 
    <ul>
      <li>Overly critical: I tend to compare myself with others, and criticise my own work. This can hinder my ability to learn
        because I spend too long worrying about how I will perceived rather than just getting stuck into a challenge. 
      </li>
      <li>Tend to spend too much time on a problem- instead of moving on to something else, or taking a break</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <br></br>
    My strengths in terms of my learning in boot camp 
    <ul>
      <li>I am patient- it makes it easier to work with others, because I don't get easily frustrated, and I can work
        through problems. 
      </li>
      <li>I am a fairly empathetic person- I can put myself in other peoples shoes. So at a time
        when we are working in an intense environment, and working through challenging 
        problems I can understand well how other people might be feeling. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Non technical challenge</h3>
    <p>
      One of the greatest challenges I feel like I will face in bootcamp is balancing 
      my family life and staying on top of material outside of class. Having two young children 
      is challenging at the best of times, and my younger child does have some health issues which 
      we are currently investigating with doctors. Since they were born, I have stayed at home with them. 
      In setting myself up for bootcamp I have organised their routines so that my support system will be available
      to take on the majority of childcare. 
      Working on projects and revising material outside of class will be important, but so will remaining 
      connected to my family.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Non technical skills</h3>
    <p>
        Over the 9 weeks of bootcamp, I hope to develop my ability to give and receive feedback. 
        I often struggle with receiving feedback and criticism, and think that it is important that 
        To go with that, I do also have trouble offering feedback. I hold back any constructive feedback
        in the fear that someone will feel the way I do when I get feedback. 
        Helping others with their work will include giving feedback. I want to be able to offer that
        to members of my cohort in a way that actually supports their learning and growth, but is also
        consistent with my values. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">My expectations from the bootcamp team</h3>
    <p>
        Throughout bootcamp, I hope that the team are available to offer technical support 
        if I am struggling with an issue- I don't expect them to solve a problem 
        for me, but to guide my research or show me if I've missed a step. 
        To me, support looks like someone willing to talk through a problem with me if 
        I am getting overwhelmed trying to work through a problem. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Expectations of myself</h3>
    <p>
        If I am struggling with something during the day, I will reach out to my facilitators or 
        to my cohort at the time. 
        If something urgent comes up with my family, I will let my facilitators know as soon 
        as I know. 
        During bootcamp I will make sure I sleep as well as I can, eat well and exercise to
        look after myself.
