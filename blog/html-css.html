  <h1>The differences between margin, border and padding</h1>


  <h3 class="text-boxes">The Box Model</h2>
  <p class="blog-text">
    One of the ways we cam look at the layout and design of a website that we are building
    is the box model. This can be shown by this image, sourced from the wikipedia
    page on the box model:
    <img class="blog-img" src="../img/boxmodelwiki.png">
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-boxes">Borders</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">
    To start off with, we can talk about the border. The border is something you
    can add around your content, for example adding a border to an image. Borders can be
    solid, like this code that I have written and applied to one image.
    This gives our image a thick, solid, purple border.

  <h3 class="text-boxes"> Margins</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">

    Next, margins! Margin is a way of describing the space around the outside of your content.
    You can use the margin to control the space around the element that you've created.
    For example, you can use "margin-bottom: 20px;" to put a small
    amount of space betwen the content you
    put in your box, and the content below it. 
    
    <img class="margin-example" src="../img/cat-5320568_640.jpg">

    See how there is some space below the image and this text, but not above? 

  </p>
  <h3 class="text-boxes">Padding</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">
    Padding can be described as the space between the content and the border of the box. We can use
    padding like this, to move our image to the right of the "box", or the webpage 
    that we are working on. Here I have used "padding-left: 500ox;" to move the 
    image to the right of the webpage, or to put space between the left side
    of the box and the image.
