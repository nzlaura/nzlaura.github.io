    <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
  
    <h2>April 2021</h2>
    <h3 class="text-boxes"> Situation where I had an ethical decision to make:</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few times in my life that I have face ethical decisions. For the most part, these
      decisions were in my work in mental health. This means that in order to protect the privacy of the
      people I worked with, it is difficult to share specific examples. I can reflect on
      the understanding of ethics in a professional setting that experience imparted
      in me though. Some of the ethical decisions I had to make reinforced one of my 
      most important values- compassion. Showing compassion first to the clients that
      I worked with allowed us to resolve any issues more easily, especially when they
      concerned ethics and boundaries.

    <h3 class ="text-boxes"> How my culture has influenced my values and identity:</h3>
    <p>
      I grew up in Auckland, in a fairly typical middle class pakeha family. I find it difficult to describe how my culture has impacted upon me because I feel that I grew up without any specific cultural influences.
      I have never considered before the kind of impact that culture has had on me. 
      When I was working on  this exercise I instead focused more on the values my family
      held influenced my identity.

    <h3 class="text-boxes">My strengths and limitations in my learning and career development </h3>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Strengths that might help in my learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that patience is a strength that will help me with my learning 
      journey. Patience will allow me to trust that learning is a process, and that
      given time I will be able to solve problems. In some ways this intersects with my issues with
      struggling to ask for help when I need it. Sometimes it might be time to stop
      being patient with a problem, and I may find it difficult to identify that.

    <h3 class="text-boxes">An example of a time when I worked with others</h3>
    <p> When I was at university I worked as a resident adviser at the hall of 
      residence where I lived. a specific example I can think of where I needed to work
      with others was area meetings. I met with residents twice every semester to discuss
      issues and and come together as a group socially. The students in my area didn't 
      understand why leaving items in the hallway was a fire hazard
      <br>
    </br>
    We would have to bring this up regularly, and remind them to keep their personal
    belongings in their rooms. this created tension because they didn't understandth
    that it was my responsibility to have them follow the rules. At the time I used 
    humour to diffuse the situation- once I made a lighthearted joke about the issue they
    seemed to understand a little better. Relfecting on that issue I think that in that
    setting I would have used the same tactic as it was appropriate to the audience. In the 
    workplace I may have used a different tactic, but in the setting it was a good way
    to address that specific issue.
