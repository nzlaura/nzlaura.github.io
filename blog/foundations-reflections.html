    <h1>Reflecting on Foundations</h1>

    <div class="blog-text">

        <p>
            I've learned a lot about myself through the core learning during foundations.
            The first, and possibly most important thing I have recognised is that I have a fear of being 
            seen to fail. I worry about other peoples opinions of my progress and my success, or lack of. I feel 
            like this is a really important thing to continue reflecting on, because I do feel like it will
            limit my success in learning and in future employment. 
            
            Secondly, I have learned that asking for help is an intrinsic part of learning in an online 
            cohort. It is easy to worry that you're the only person that needs help. Reaching out for help
            not only helps my learning and progress, but is also valuable for the person offering help. Having to put
            what you know into words that are easily understandable to another person is a great way of learning too. 

            Thirdly I was reminded of the value in journalling. I really feel like that was one of the best 
            takeaways for me from core. It is a way of privately reflecting on my experiences and emotions, and 
            has helped me better identify where I am getting stuck in my learnings.

           When we are dealing with situations in the workplace, the classroom and in our personal lives, our values help 
           guide us. Understanding exactly what those are and how they impact us can help us make decisons, especially 
           ethical decisions in ways that are consistent with who we are. 
           <br></br>
           Empathy is an important skill to have in all aspects of our lives, not only in devacademy and in our careers.
           When we are learning in an intensive course, there will no doubt be moments of frustration with those around us. 
           Being able to stop, and think about the emotions and cognitions of the person we are working with will make us
           more able to show compassion and work through a problem. 
           <br></br>
            Self awareness is so important for our wellbeing, as well. Being aware of ourselves can help us use the skills 
            we are equipped with to look after our mental and physical health. Being self aware as well means we are aware
            of our technical capabilities and limitations as well, so when we are taking on a challenge or problem, we know 
            what help we will need to tackle a new challenge. 
        </p>
        <br></br>

            Learning about the growth/fixed mindset was a really surprising and revealing part of the core programme for me. 
            I felt as if the fixed mindset was describing me exactly. Understanding that with practice that it's possible
            to change that mindset, and that change might make me a better learner was a good discovery for me.
            Another suprising element of the core knowledge for me was the exploration of listening and looping. I found that 
            it was good to be able to listen to someone talking and not feel pressure to respond until after- and that I struggled
            to talk for long periods of time without interruption. Before this exercise I thought that talking would be the easy part. 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            For me the most challenging aspect of the core learning was practicing mindfulness. I have 
            always struggled with mindfulness, and working through it in sprint three was hard for me. I tried 
            to commit to regular mindfulness practice, but I am still not skilled at it. 
            Another challenging thing I found was that being aware of an unhelpful mindset did not mean
            I could automatically change the way that I think and react in a challenging situation. An example of this 
            is working through the JavaScript carnival, I felt overwhelmed and panicked, but the self critical voice 
            I have was telling me I was the only one struggling, and reaching out for help would make me look like a failure. 
            In reality, the failing would have been not reaching out for help when I couldn't make it through a problem alone. 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
           I believe that devacademy focuses on core because it helps us become better programmers. Coding and learning
           technical skills are important, but they can only get you so far in your career. 
           <br></br>
           The core learning that we do in foundations is a valuable part of the course. I feel like we spent a good 
           amount of time learning the code. The pace of the technical learning in sprint 4 and 5 felt quite quick to me, 
           so I feel like any more technical content in that short space of time may have been overwhelming. Learning the core skills was 
           not a wasted of time in any way, it complements the learning- especially the sections on neuroplasticity and problem solving.
