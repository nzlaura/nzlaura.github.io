    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <div class="blog-text">
      <h3 class="text-boxes">Hmmm, I seem to have run into a problem</h3>
        <p>
          When I was working on the exercises to practice JavaScript, a coding language
          I ran across a bit of trouble when I was working through an exercise 
          called "fizzbuzz". The aim of this problem was to replace numbers that were
          divisible by 3 with the word "fizz", numbers that were divisible by the number
          5 with the word "buzz" and numbers divisible by the number 15 with "FizzBuzz"! 
          <br></br>
        The maths seemed pretty straightforward, but no matter what I did, nothing seemed
        to make the code work to return "FizzBuzz"!. I thought I might have written the function 
        wrong, and I tried a few different types of solution. But I was sure that
        what I had written should work! I got quite frustrated working through this,
        and couldn't seem to figure out why my code wasn't working. 
          </br></br>
        After a bit of research, I remembered that unless you tell it otherwise, JavaScript
        works from the first piece of code through to the last.
        Once I switched the piece of 
        code that returned "FizzBuzz" if the number was divisible by 15 to be the first 
        number the code looked for, my code worked. It was a good reminder that sometimes
        it's important to look back over the basics in your code, and not necessarily jump
        to worrying that I needed to create more complex code to solve problems. 
            
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-boxes">What are some problem solving techniques?</h3>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
          Pseudocode is a great way of breaking down a function into bite sized pieces.
          Instead of jumping straight in to writing code, you add comments to your code 
          describing exactly what you want your code to do. I do find this useful,
          because I find it intimidating to write code from a blank slate. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Trying something</h3>
        <p>
            Not the method that I'm most confident with. Just jumping and trying 
            something often led me to become more frustrated with the learning 
            process. Just getting started and trying something was helpful 
            in some situations- there was one problem where I decided to just try the 
            simplest solution I could think of, and it worked. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text"> Rubber ducky (or dinosaur!) method</h3>
        <p>
            I'm still trying to get the hang of this one- explaining your code to your
            rubber duck, or in my case the plastic dinosaurs my young children gifted
            to me
        </p>

        <h3 class="underline-text">Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
          When I was using replit, this was particularly helpful- especially when 
          I was trying to ask for help from others in my cohort. The error messages
          also often tell you exactly what line the error is on, giving you a helpful
          hint as to where to look for problems. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
          When I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my code, this was a good technique
          to see exactly what my code was returning. I'm not entirely confident using it,
          but I do feel like it's a useful tool for problem solving. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Googling</h3>
        <p>
          I found google a great resource. When I ran into issues with my coding syntax, 
          this was particularly helpful. It also helped me write out exactly what the problem
          I was facing was. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Asking peers for help</h3>
        <p>
          When I was working through the JavaScript katas, I did reach out for help
          when I had exhausted my other options. I found it really useful- the other
         people in the cohort were working through the same problems as I was, and they
         had useful advice when I couldn't figure something out. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="underline-text">Asking coaches for help </h3>
        <p>
          I haven't reached out to my facilitor for help yet, but I think that the weekly
          meetings are really great for reflecting on the week of work. 
        </p>
        <h3 class ="underline-text">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Since the second sprint, I have been journalling daily. I find being able 
          to write down my frustrations with the technology, and my problem solving processes
          really helpful. I feel like I don't yet have enough technical knowledge to go 
          back and refactor my code on reflection. A lot of the tasks in this sprint I found
          difficult, but I imagine with time and experience reflecting on my code will be valuable.
