    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

      <h3 class="text-boxes">Hmmm, I seem to have run into a problem</h3>
        <p>
          When I was working on the exercises to practice JavaScript, a coding language
          I ran across a bit of trouble when I was working through an exercise 
          called "fizzbuzz". The aim of this problem was to replace numbers that were
          divisible by 3 with the word "fizz", numbers that were divisible by the number
          5 with the word "buzz" and numbers divisible by the number 15 with "FizzBuzz"! 
          <br></br>
        The maths seemed pretty straightforward, but no matter what I did, nothing seemed
        to make the code work to return "FizzBuzz"!. I thought I might have written the function 
        wrong, and I tried a few different types of solution. But I was sure that
        what I had written should work! I got quite frustrated working through this,
        and couldn't seem to figure out why my code wasn't working. 
          </br></br>
        After a bit of research, I remembered that unless you tell it otherwise, JavaScript
        works from the first piece of code through to the last.
        Once I switched the piece of 
        code that returned "FizzBuzz" if the number was divisible by 15 to be the first 
        number the code looked for, my code worked. It was a good reminder that sometimes
        it's important to look back over the basics in your code, and not necessarily jump
        to worrying that I needed to create more complex code to solve problems.
