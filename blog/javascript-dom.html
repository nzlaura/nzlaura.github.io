 HTML and CSS are like the builder and the architect. HTML is the builder-
 the builder creates the structure of the building, and makes sure that the
 house works, that it's functional. The architect designs the home- picks the 
 materials, the colours, the design. But both have to work with each other-
 the architect can't design a house that is impossible for the builder
 to build, and the builder uses the design information to create the house. 
 I feel this analogy works well for HTML and CSS because HTML is much like the builder,
 building the structure and the content of the website. CSS is like the architect,
 creating the design of the website. But both have to be mindful of each other
 in order to create a function and good looking website.

  An Array is a variable where you can store a value, or a list of values. It would look something like this: 
  <img class="blog-img" src="/img/Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.28.05 PM.png">
  An object is something you can use to
  represent a thing in your code, it could look something like this: 
  <img class="blog-img" src="/img/Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.28.17 PM.png"
