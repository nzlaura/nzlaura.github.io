    <h3 class="text-boxes">HTML & CSS</h3>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are like the builder and the architect. HTML is the builder-
      the builder creates the structure of the building, and makes sure that the
      house works, that it's functional. The architect designs the home- picks the
      materials, the colours, the design. But both have to work with each other-
      the architect can't design a house that is impossible for the builder
      to build, and the builder uses the design information to create the house.
      I feel this analogy works well for HTML and CSS because HTML is much like the builder,
      building the structure and the content of the website. CSS is like the architect,
      creating the design of the website. But both have to be mindful of each other
      in order to create a function and good looking website.

    <h3 class="text-boxes">Control Flow</h3>
    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which the statements in your code are executed.
      As a general rule, JavaScript operates the code from the first line until the last.
      You can alter the control flow to execute differently with statements and functions.
      One statement that can alter the flow of the code is the if/else statement. If else
      statements can be used to ...

      To illustrate this, we can take the real life example of getting my son ready for
      school in the morning. We have to complete all these tasks each day to get ready:
      <br></br>

      <br></br>
      But, what happens if we had run out of lunchbox ingredients, lost his toothbrush, or
      had no clean socks left in his drawers? We would be unable to complete this sequence
      of events without altering the flow of events
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">What is the DOM? How can I use it?</h3>
    <p>
      The DOM, or document object model is a way of interacting with the different elements
      in a webpage. It represennts all of the HTML document used in a webpage. It is like a family
      tree for the HTML we've used on a webpage. Expanded out, it looks something like this:
      <br></br>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../img/DOMtree.gif">
      <br></br>
      -Image source <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">W3schools.com</a>
      <br></br>
      One example of how we might use the DOM is when we are working on a webpage, we could
      use it to find out which class is assigned to an element on the page. From there,
      we can use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML or CSS to change how it appears on the 
      page. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Arrays? Objects? How do we access them</h3>
    <p>
      An Array is a variable where you can store a value, or a list of values. It would look something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="../img/Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 3.28.05 PM.png">
    <p>
      An object is something you can use to
      represent a thing in your code. The difference between
      an array and an object is that an object consists of only one type of data.
      For example, this variable I've written contains three seperate objects: a string,
      a number and a boolean.
      <img src="../img/Screen Shot 2021-05-01 at 7.40.24 PM.png">
      <br></br>
      To access the information in an array, you can use square brackets to access the
      location of a specific piece of information. To access the string "Cats" in the
      array pictured, it would be at location [0]. In JavaScript, the first object
      in an array is considered to be at position "0"
      Accessing the information in an object is
      simply accessed by using the objects name.

    </p>
    <h3 class="text-boxes">Functions & why they are useful</h3>
    <p>
      Functions are statements that perform a task or calculation using information that
      you give them- parameters, and give an output. While we could write code without
      using functions, we would end up with code that was thousands and thousands of lines long.
      Functions are useful because we can make our code more concise. Functions can
      be used throughout a script- they can be used more than once in our code.
      This makes it easier to read, edit and debug. If we are collaborating on our code,
      it makes it clear what we are trying to achieve.
