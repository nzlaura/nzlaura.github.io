  <h1> Emotional intelligence </h1>

  <h2>April 2021</h2>
  <h3 class="text-boxes"> What is emotional intelligence, anyway?</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">
    Emotional intelligence can be considered in a number of different ways. Simply put,
    it is a measure of our competency in perceiving, controlling and evaluation emotions
    in ourselves and others. Emotional intelligence is a fairly modern idea- theories
    about it and its importance only surfaced in the 1990s.

    On positive psychology (<a href="https://positivepsychology.com/emotional-intelligence-theories/" )>link</a>)
    they break emotional intelligence down into five distinct components.</p>

  <ol class="list-orientation">
    <li> Self awareness: our capacity to notice and understand our own emotions</li>
    <li>Self regulation: how competent we are at expressing our emotions appropriately</li>
    <li>Social skills: how we interact with other people, including things like active listening, verbal communication
      skills</li>
    <li>Empathy: understanding the feelings of people around us. </li>
    <li>Motivation: this one specifically refers to intrinsic motivation </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="blog-text">
    So one way we can look at emotional intelligence is as a cluster of skills that allow us to
    connect with ourselves and the people around us.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-boxes"> What's the difference between IQ and EQ?</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">
    IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a way to measure a persons reasoning ability. It measures
    your ability to solve problems and use logic, whereas EQ is a measure of your emotional 
    intelligence. 

  </p>
  <h3 class="text-boxes"> So, why is EQ important?</h3>
  <p class="blog-text">
    Understanding our emotions, expressing them clearly and being able to decode
    the emotions of the people around us are useful tools. If we are emotionally intelligent 
    we can better move through conflict, better interact with the people around us
    and understand ourselves. 
<br></br>
    Another perspective we can look at is that of compassion and empathy.
    If we are able to understand others emotions and the cognitive processes that go
    along with them, it can make it easier to extend empathy in difficult
    or conflict situtations.
