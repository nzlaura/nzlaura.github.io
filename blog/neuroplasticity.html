        <h3 class="text-boxes">Neuroplasticity and its benefits</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding what neuroplasticity is, and why it is helpful can help us
            to learn new things, and shape the pathways in our brain positively.
            If we understand what neuroplasticity is and how we can increase it, it can not
            only make us more effective learners, but inform the way we approach our learning.
            <br></br>
            In my research on neuroplasticity, I came across the idea that the way each of us learn is highly
            individual, and that
            patterns of neuroplasticity are different in every individual. A way that I could engage with this is to
            reflect on the
            ways that I learn best, and repeat those actions to increase my learning. I can also use positive habits and
            behaviours- such
            as exercise and journalling to shape my brain in positive ways. Because neuroplasticity can also be
            negative, so engaging
            in things that are beneficial to me can help boost my ability to engage with learning.

            There are many different activities that we can engage in to help us increase our neuroplasticity.
            <br></br>
            A non exhaustive list of some activities that can increase neuroplasticity:

            <li>Exercise</li>
            <li>Meditation and mindfulness</li>

            <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="text-boxes">Growth vs Fixed mindset</h3>
        <p>
            A growth mindset "thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a
            heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities". It is the opposite of
            a fixed mindset- in which we might consider our intelligence, success and ability to face challenges
            as something that we are innately born with and unable to change.
            <br></br>
            It is relevant, especially when we are learning because it can shape the way we see our progress and
            learning journey.
            If we have a fixed mindset, we believe that our intelligence, capability for learning and creativity are
            hardwired into
            us, and that failure is something to be avoided at all costs. In coding, and learning to be a software
            developer, failure is somewhat inevitable. A growth mindset is relevant, because if we adopt this mindset we
            can turn
            our failures into opportunities to learn about ourselves, and learn new skills.
            <br></br>
            Honestly, I am a person that has had a fixed mindset. When I was at school, I was in gifted classes and
            accelerate classes.
            Learning in this environment left me with the impression that intelligence was something that I had or
            didn't have.
            I have had a difficult relationship with failure- believing that I lacked intelligence.
            <br></br>
            What has changed for me? I want to shift the way I think into a growth mindset. I have always believed that
            other
            people around me have capacity for growth and change. I have worked with something called a strengths based
            approach in my
            professional life. The way the strengths framework worked was that we focused on peoples strengths over
            their weakness
            in order to help them set goals and improve their wellbeing.
            So if I am able to believe this of other people, changing the way I view myself and learning in general
            could help me to better face challenges and failure.
