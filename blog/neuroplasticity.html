        <p>
            Understanding what neuroplasticity is, and why it is helpful can help us
            to learn new things, and shape the pathways in our brain positively.
            If we understand what neuroplasticity is and how we can increase it, it can not
            only make us more effective learners, but inform the way we approach our learning.
            <br></br>
            In my research on neuroplasticity, I came across the idea that the way each of us learn is highly
            individual, and that
            patterns of neuroplasticity are different in every individual. A way that I could engage with this is to
            reflect on the
            ways that I learn best, and repeat those actions to increase my learning. I can also use positive habits and
            behaviours- such
            as exercise and journalling to shape my brain in positive ways. Because neuroplasticity can also be
            negative, so engaging
            in things that are beneficial to me can help boost my ability to engage with learning.

            There are many different activities that we can engage in to help us increase our neuroplasticity.
            A non exhaustive list of some of these activities:
